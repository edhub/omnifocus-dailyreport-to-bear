# omnifocus-dailyreport-to-bear
This is a scripting file which export tasks in OmniFocus completed yesterday to Bear Note.

## Why I created it
I use OmniFocus a lot. I use Bear Notes a lot.

And I learn x-callback-url by chance.

hmm...

I'll combine them together.

Someone already created a report maker, but the output is going into a file. And I want it go into Bear Notes.

I want to learn automation BTW.

## Usage recommendation
Download the compiled script.

In OmniFocus -> Help -> Open Script Folder. Drop the script in.

OmniFocus -> View -> Customize Toolbar.  Find the script action, add it to the toolbar.

Click the icon. Your report is now finished!
